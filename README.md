# Reddit_Bot
This Bot displays LIVE count of Upvotes/Downvotes on your latest post on Reddit.

## Prerequisites for Running Source Code
1. Google Chrome Web Browser
### Python Libraries
1. Selenium
2. Tkinter
3. Pillow (PIL)

## NOTE:
The Bot will prompt the user to enter their username and password. During password entry the user will not see any letters being typed but are input invisibly. This is just for security purposes so that the bitch next to you does not see your password :)

## Prerequisites for Executable
Microsoft Windows Operating System

## Troubleshooting
1. Windows executable file is in the "dist" folder by the name "Reddit_Bot.exe".
2. If you are facing any problems executing the source code then consider upgrading all your python packages.
